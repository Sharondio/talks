<h1> Adding AngularJS to Existing Apps</h1>
<h3> Getting the UI Sugar...Without the jQuery Pain</h3>

NCDevCon, September 2013

Sharon DiOrio &bull; [@sharondio](https://twitter.com/sharondio)

<aside class="notes">Hi, my name is Sharon, and I'm a recovering ColdFusion Developer.
  [pause for "hi sharon"]
  I'm currently a Senior Web Developer for Euro-Pro. We're a Billion-dollar company that nobody has ever heard of. Sort of. We make the shark vacuum and ninja kitchen products. You may have seen our owner on late-night infomercials selling vacuums and steam mops.

<h2> My story</h2>
<h3> ColdFusion was my life</h3>
<img src="images/old_school.png">

<aside class="notes">It all began when my Filemaker Pro rep went to Allaire and called me about this cool new software I should look at. I went to the demo with a colleague who was doing web work with Oracle web server. We watched the simple demos with CF talking to the DB and displaying data. Her jaw hung open. She shared that that little bit of magic would've taken her 3 days of coding with Oracle. So I immediately got ahold of a demo copy of CF version 3.0 (the first hit is free) and tied a database to the web for the first time. I knew then, I was hooked.</aside>

<aside class="notes">In order to feed my habit, I found positions with various companies. Fortunately for me, ColdFusion has served as a sort of "prescreening" for companies I'd want to work for. Pragmatic companies. Companies that made technical decisions based on the right tool rather than whatever MS was peddling.</aside>

<h2> Why move to Javascript?</h2>

<aside class="notes">Note: I was always able to find CF work. That's never been the problem. In fact, even now I get recruiters contacting me for CF. But I was getting bored. I didn't get the same "high" I'd gotten in years past from doing cool stuff. I knew it was time to add to the toolbox, but what to choose? It was very apparent to me that that market was evolving rapidly. Instead of heavy middleware apps, people were migrating to well-organized services and putting more logic in the client.</aside>

<h2> Why Angular?</h2>

<img src="images/popularity.jpeg" width="800">

<aside class="notes">If you can't really see the slide, the blue line is AngularJS, the red line is node.js and the green line is backbone. Ember is down there at the bottom in purple. Hey, somebody tell Sean Corfield that Clojure is more popular than Ember and Backbone!
<br><br>
  So Angular is popular. So popular it's actually hip. Because most of you are Coldfusion people, I will assume that you're not here because Angular is hip. 
<br><br>
  When I started at Euro-Pro, we were using CanJS on the front-end and python web services with MS SQL via ORM on the back-end.
 It was pretty clunky, so I was tasked with finding new options. Evaluating frameworks is overwhelming. I read blog posts and played with demos. Then I got to Angular. In one night, I'd rewritten a common list interface that was plaguing us in one of our apps. I brought it in to demo to my boss (one of the reasons for learning this stuff) and we just grinned. We'd found our framework. As an aside, the community surrounding this framework is probably the best I've experienced since CF.</aside>

<aside class="notes">I'd gone to CF.Objective this past spring and saw a couple of great Angular talks. They both walked through a demo app and did a good job explaining the framework. But something was missing. Talking with friends afterwards, we realized that people loved the talks, but they didn't know where to begin. See, most of us are stuck with code like that. We can't just rewrite everything as a front-end application. And all the demos assume you're doing just that. Yeah, yeah, ToDos...but what about my app? So I thought about what I'd want out of a presentation if I were still stuck maintaining code like that.
<br><br>
So I had to ask myself...what would you want?

<aside class="notes">
Other than Ray Camden maybe. 
<br><br>
And don't get me wrong, jQuery was a huge improvement over dealing with the DOM directly. But actually coding in jQuery was really not fun. Picture me sitting there with this face on...trying to traverse the DOM in my head and translating that into jQuery selectors...then binding to the right elements...and so on. Or looking at the HTML and trying to guess which element the jQuery was going to be affecting. IDs everywhere!
<br><br>
It's no fun because it's imperative programming applied to the DOM.

<h2> Geek Trivia</h2>

<h3>Imperative vs. Declarative</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Imperative is explicitly the DOM what to do and how to do it.</li>
  <li>Declarative is describing what we want, and let the underlying systems figure out how to make it happen.</li>
</ul>

<aside class="notes">
  Not important to know this, but I like having terms for things. Besides, you've already done lots of both.

<h2>Look familiar?</h2>

<cfloop query="myData">
    #name# #address# ...
</cfloop>

<aside class="notes">
ColdFusion is very declarative. I, for one, have always loved the fact that I could look at the CFML mark-up and know exactly what each element was supposed to be doing. 
</aside>

</section><section>

<h2>Angular is very declarative too.</h2>

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
<div ng-repeat="item in myData">
    {{item.name}} {{item.address}}
</div>
</code></pre>
<aside class="notes">
  The Google guys may not like the comparison, but Angular actually does have a bit in common with ColdFusion. Angular has been described as "HTML extended". Well, guess what, CF has been doing that since 1995. What CF did with CFML tags, Angular is doing with directives. Angular includes a bunch of core directives, just like CF includes core tags. And both allow you to extend and make your own functionality, what CF calls custom tags, Angular calls...well, they still call them directives.

  This is it. This is a fully-functioning, Angular app. OK, it's not an MVC app, it's just a MV app, but what it does is still pretty cool.
  <br><br>
  Ng-app is where it all begins. This is how Angular knows to attach itself to the DOM. You can use any HTML element. I'm using the html element here so that the entire page is under Angular control. But you can limit Angular to just a single div. In fact, you can even bootstrap multiple angular apps to different sections.
  <br><br>
  You'll also see another directive here: ng-model. What this directive does is tell Angular that this input is bound to the model "my_model". The awesomesauce of Angular is two-way data binding on any javascript object. In this case, it's just a string, but it could be an object or array as well. And anywhere that model is updated, it's reflected in other references to that object.
  <br><br>
  OK, that really didn't knock your hair back...let's try it with a controller.

<aside class="notes">
  In this one, we're declaring an app module. Angular is very module based, and this helps keep the code more organized into apps. 
  <br><br>
  We're also building our first controller. Controllers are the glue that ties everything together. You bind a controller to an HTML element with ng-controller. The next thing you might notice is the $scope prefix. $scope is a variable scope that is shared by the view and the controller. A lot of developers trip over $scope when first working with Angular, but after dealing with ColdFusion variable scopes, it felt fairly natural to me. Angular even has $rootScope, which is a scope shared across a whole application...you know, like Application scope.
  <br><br>
  You'll also notice that "$scope" was injected into the controller. Angular is big on dependency injection, and if you haven't done a lot with it before, it will feel a little cumbersome. But once you graduate to bigger apps and testing, you'll see how it simplifies everything.

<aside class="notes">
  When I look at demos, the first thing I want to do is talk to data. Unfortunately, most of the online demos don't do that because they can't host an actual demo app online. But I can.
  <br><br>
  Now, if your conventional app looks like the code sample I shared in the beginning, I have some bad news for you... But if you already have some data cfcs setup, most of your work is already done. Most angular demos show Angular talking to a nice, orderly REST interface. But you don't have to. So long as the returned data is JSON, angular doesn't care.
  <br><br>
  A lot of demos use $resource. There is nothing special about $resource except that it's optimized for REST interfaces and has some niceties built into it.
  <br><br>
  You can also use $http to pull back a flat json file. Angular doesn't care.

  I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this, but I wanted to show a better way of doing the data handling. Services are shared singletons injected into controllers. Because they're singletons, they're also a good way to share data between controllers.

  Just wanted to show a more expanded service. You can group functions together in a service by using the "this" namespace.
